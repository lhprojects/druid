There are a few options in current release to save machine time. 

1, Projective view, by default is muted. 
You can change the value of FlagMultiView at line 50 of Druid.cc to reactive. 

2, A row of four buttons can be found at the Druid GUI. 

   Third button: used to swithch between minimal display senario or full display senario:
   At minimal senario, only simulated detector hits, MCParticle, ReconParticle and clusters are displayed;
   At full senario, Druid displays everything it can.
   Druid judges a collection to be displayed or not by its type, which can be personalized at loadevent.cc. 
   The default setting is minimal display senario.

   By default, no text are attached to the displayed objects expect MCParticles/reconstructed particles.
